# Result Notifier

I have used multiple library to implement result notifier algorithm. So, Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependency.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### To run the program.

Open Console

Go to the directory of the program file and then execute below line in the console
```
python Notifier.py
```
You can see an output in the console.

This program requests gtu result site and fetch all the declared results.
